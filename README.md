# Computer Science study repository
A personal collection of algorithms, data structures and computer science concepts with some of their implementations for personal study.  
Directories and code in them are organized by logical categories rather than in a functional way. Most of the algorithms and data structures come with a very simple test program that you can build by running the following inside their directory:  
```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Disclaimer! This repository is still *very* WIP.
